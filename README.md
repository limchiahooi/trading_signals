## About
- FBM KLCI is Malaysia's stock market benchmark index, composed of the 30 largest companies on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation.
- The trading signals (buy and sell) in the chart above are generated using a candlestick chart pattern recognition model written in Python.
- The model scans the chart for 5 popular candlestick patterns (Inverted Hammer, Engulfing, Piercing Line, Morning Star and Three White Soldiers) and plot the signals on the chart if they are identified. More info on these patterns on [Investopedia website](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/062315/using-bullish-candlestick-patterns-buy-stocks.asp).
- The objective of this project is to visualize and document the trading signals as a proof of concept for the model. The candlestick chart and trading signals are visualized using [plotly.py](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/).
